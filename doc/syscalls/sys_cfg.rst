EwoK ressource reconfiguration API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Synopsis
""""""""

The resources (GPIOs, DMA, etc.) reconfiguration request is done by the
sys_cfg() syscall family. The sys_cfg() family supports the following
prototypes::

   e_syscall_ret sys_cfg(CFG_GPIO_SET, uint8_t gpioref, uint8_t value);
   e_syscall_ret sys_cfg(CFG_GPIO_GET, uint8_t gpioref, uint8_t *val);
   e_syscall_ret sys_cfg(CFG_GPIO_UNLOCK_EXTI, uint8_t gpioref)
   e_syscall_ret sys_cfg(CFG_DMA_RECONF, dma_t*dma, dma_reconf_mask_t reconfmask);
   e_syscall_ret sys_cfg(CFG_DMA_RELOAD, uint32_t dma_id);
   e_syscall_ret sys_cfg(CFG_DMA_DISABLE, uint32_t dma_id);
   e_syscall_ret sys_cfg(CFG_DEV_MAP, uint8_t dev_id);
   e_syscall_ret sys_cfg(CFG_DEV_UNMAP, uint8_t dev_id);
   e_syscall_ret sys_cfg(CFG_DEV_RELEASE, uint8_t dev_id);


sys_cfg(CFG_GPIO_SET)
"""""""""""""""""""""

GPIOs are not directly mapped in the task's memory. As a consequence, setting
the GPIO output value, for GPIO in output mode, must be done using a syscall.
There is no need to use the entire GPIO structure (or parent device_t
structure) to set a GPIO. As described in the ``sys_init(INIT_DEVACCESS)``
explanations, each GPIO has a kref identifier. This identifier is used here to
identify the GPIO when asking the kernel for an action on it.

Setting an output GPIO previously registered is done with the following API::

   e_syscall_ret sys_cfg(CFG_GPIO_SET, uint8_t gpioref, uint8_t value);

The value set is the one given in third argument.

.. important::
  The GPIO to set must have been previously declared in the initialization phase.

sys_cfg(CFG_GPIO_GET)
"""""""""""""""""""""

In the same way, getting a GPIO value for a GPIO configured in input mode is
done using a syscall.

GPIOs are not directly mapped in the task's memory. As a consequence, in the
same way as for ``sys_cfg(CFG_GPIO_SET)`` getting a GPIO value for a GPIO in
input mode must be done using a syscall.

Following the same manner, there is no need to use the entire GPIO structure (or parent
device_t structure) to set a GPIO. As described in the
``sys_init(INIT_DEVACCESS)`` explanations, each GPIO has a kref identifier.
This identifier is used here to identify the GPIO when asking the kernel for an
action on it.

Getting an input value of a GPIO previously registered is done with the
following API::

   e_syscall_ret sys_cfg(CFG_GPIO_GET, uint8_t gpioref, uint8_t *val);

The value read is set in the syscall third argument.

.. important::
  The GPIO value to get must have been previously declared in the
  initialization phase.

sys_cfg(CFG_GPIO_UNLOCK_EXTI)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. note::
   Synchronous syscall, executable in ISR mode

There are times when external interrupts may:
   * Arise only one time and need to be muted voluntarily for a given amount of
     time
   * Be unstable and generate uncontrolled bursts, when the external IP is not
     clean and has hardware bugs

For these two cases, the EwoK kernel supports a specific GPIO
configuration which allows, when an EXTI interrupt is configured, to choose
whether:

   * The EXTI line is masked at handler time, by the kernel. The user ISR will be
     executed but there will be no more EXTI interrupts pending on the
     interrupt line
   * The EXTI line is not masked, and the EXTI is only acknowledged. The EXTI
     source can continue to emit other interrupts and the userspace ISR handler
     will be executed for each of them

The choice is done using the `exti_lock` field of the gpio structure, using
either:

   * GPIO_EXTI_UNLOCKED value: the EXTI line is not masked and will continue to
     arise when the external HW IP emits events
   * GPIO_EXTI_LOCKED value: the EXTI line is masked each time the interrupt
     arises. As a consequence, the userspace task needs to unmask it voluntarily
     using a specific syscall, otherwise no other EXTI will be received.

To unmask a given EXTI interrupt, a userspace task uses the
``sys_cfg(CFG_GPIO_UNLOCK_EXTI)`` syscall. This syscall has the following API::

   e_syscall_ret sys_cfg(CFG_GPIO_EXTI_UNLOCK, uint8_t gpioref);

The gpioref value is the kref identifier of the GPIO, like the one used in the
other GPIO manipulation syscalls. Unlocking the EXTI line is a synchronous
syscall.

.. important::
  The GPIO value to get must have been previously declared in the
  initialization phase.



sys_cfg(CFG_DMA_RECONF)
"""""""""""""""""""""""

.. note::
   Synchronous syscall, executable in ISR mode

In a generic DMA channel usage, it is a standard behavior to reconfigure a part
of the DMA channel information. This is for example the case for input or
output buffers when using direct access mode with chained data, our circular
buffers.

EwoK allows some reconfiguration of DMA channels, in a controlled way. Only
some fields of the ``dma_t`` can be reconfigured. This is the case of:

   * ISR handlers address
   * Input buffer address (for memory to peripheral mode)
   * Output buffer address (for peripheral to memory mode)
   * Buffer size
   * DMA mode (direct, FIFO or circular)
   * DMA priority

In order to reconfigure only a subset of theses fields, a mask exists specifying
which field(s) need(s) to be reconfigured.

As these fields are a part of the ``dma_t`` structure (see Ewok kernel API
technical reference documentation), the syscall requires this entire structure.
This is also required to determine which DMA channel is targeted by this
syscall, by using the DMA id set in this structure by the kernel at
initialization time.

Reconfiguring a part of a DMA stream is done with the following API::

   e_syscall_ret sys_cfg(CFG_DMA_RECONF, dma_t*dma, dma_reconf_mask_t
   reconfmask);


.. hint::
   The easiest way to use this syscall is to keep the dma_tÂ structure used
   during the initialization phase and to update it during the nominal phase

.. important::
   The DMA that needs to be reconfigured must have been previously declared in
   the initialization phase.

sys_cfg(CFG_DMA_RELOAD)
"""""""""""""""""""""""

.. note::
   Synchronous syscall, executable in ISR mode

There are some times when we only want the DMA controller to restart a copy
action, without modifying any of its properties. In this specific case, only a
reload is needed. The kernel only needs to identify the DMA controller and
stream, and doesn't need a whole DMA structure. The task can then use only the
``id`` field of the ``dma_t`` structure.

Reloading a DMA stream is done with the following API::

   e_syscall_ret sys_cfg(CFG_DMA_RELOAD, uint32_t dma_id);

.. important::
  The DMA that needs to be reloaded must have been previously declared in the
  initialization phase.

sys_cfg(CFG_DMA_DISABLE)
""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. note::
   Synchronous syscall, executable in ISR mode

It is possible to disable a DMA stream. In this case, the DMA is stopped and
can be re-enabled only by calling one of sys_cfg(CFG_DMA_RELOAD) or
sys_cfg(CFG_DMA_RECONF) syscalls.

This is useful for DMA streams in circular mode, as they never stop unless the
software asks them to.

Disabling a DMA stream is done with the following API::

   e_syscall_ret sys_cfg(CFG_DMA_DISABLE, uint32_t dma_id);

.. important::
  The DMA that needs to be disabled must have been previously declared in the
  initialization phase.

sys_cfg(CFG_DEV_MAP)
""""""""""""""""""""

.. note::
   Synchronous syscall, executable only in main thread mode

It is possible to declare a device as voluntary mapped (field ``map_mode`` of
the *device_t* structure.  This field can be set to the following values:

   * DEV_MAP_AUTO
   * DEV_MAP_VOLUNTARY

When using DEV_MAP_AUTO, the device is automatically mapped in the task address
space when finishing the initialization phase, and is kept mapped until the
end of the task life-cycle.

When using DEV_MAP_VOLUNTARY, the device is not mapped by the kernel and the
task has to map the device itself (later in the life-cycle). In that case,
the device is mapped using this very syscall.

Voluntary mapped devices permit to map, configure and unmap in sequence more
than the maximum number of concurrently mapped devices. It also allows to avoid
mapping devices for which concurrent mapping is dangerous (e.g. concatenated
mappings).

Mapping a device is done using the device id, hosted in the ``id`` field of the
*device_t* structure, which is set by the kernel at registration time.

Mapping a device is done with the following API::

   e_syscall_ret sys_cfg(CFG_DEV_MAP, uint8_t dev_id);

.. important::
   Declaring a voluntary mapped device requires a specific permission:
   PERM_RES_MEM_DMAP

.. note::
   Mapping a device requires a call to the scheduler, in order to reconfigure
   the MPU, this action is costly

sys_cfg(CFG_DEV_UNMAP)
""""""""""""""""""""""

.. note::
   Synchronous syscall, executable only in main thread mode

When using DEV_MAP_VOLUNTARY, a previously voluntary mapped device can be unmapped
by the task.  Unmapping a device frees a MPU slot when the task requires more
than the maximum number of concurrently usable MPU slots by managing devices in
sequence in the main thread.

.. important::
   While the device is configured, device's ISR still maps the device, even if
   it is unmapped from the main thread

.. important::
   Unmapping a device does not mean disabling it, the hardware device still works
   and emits IRQs that are handled by the task's registered ISR. It is the task's
   duty to properly disable the device before unammping it if necessary

.. note::
   Unmapping a device requires a call to the scheduler, in order to reconfigure
   the MPU, this action is costly

Unmapping a device is done using the device id, hosted in the ``id`` field of
the *device_t* structure, which is set by the kernel at registration time.

Unmapping a device is done with the following API::

   e_syscall_ret sys_cfg(CFG_DEV_UNMAP, uint8_t dev_id);


sys_cfg(CFG_DEV_RELEASE)
""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. note::
   Synchronous syscall, executable only in main thread mode

A task may want, at a given time of its life-cycle, to stop to use a given
device. This can be done by requesting the kernel to release the device using
its device descriptor.  The device is then fully deactivated (including
associated RCC clock and interrupts) and fully removed from the task's context.

.. warning::
   This action is **definitive**. The device is released until reboot

Because of the EwoK task life-cycle paradigm including a separated declarative
phase (so called initialization phase), a released device should never be
allocated by another task. This can only happen if the device is released by a
given task before another task has finished its initialization phase.

.. danger::
   You should **not** use nominal and initializing phases overlapping between
   tasks to avoid potential unvoluntary device sharing associated to device
   release, Take care to synchronize init sequences correctly.  The kernel
   **does not** clear the device registers at release time

Releasing a device is done with the following API::

   e_syscall_ret sys_cfg(CFG_DEV_RELEASE, uint8_t dev_id);
