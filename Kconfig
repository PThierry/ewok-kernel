config ADAKERNEL
  bool "Ada & SPARK kernel implementation"
  default n
  ---help---
  This option activate the usage of Ada and Spark sources in
  replacement of C code for the kernel runtime. This permits
  to compile an hardened kernel based on the efficient properties
  of the Ada language, mixed with residual C code for libbsp.

config KERNEL_NOSERIAL
  bool "No kernel serial interface (production mode)"
  default n
  ---help---
  This option deactivate the kernel serial interface. There is
  no more information printed out on any serial interface.
  Userspace applications printf content will be deleted by
  the kernel.
  The kernel usart interface is *not* activated.
  This mode is a self-protection mechanism to avoid any leak
  due to debug message content. The kernel usart attack surface
  is also closed. This should be the standard behavior of a production
  mode.

    bool "Freeze on panic"
    ---help---
       Freeze the system on kernel panic(). This freeze the execution.
       All the software stack is still mapped in flash and RAM. Useful
       for debugging purpose.

    config KERNEL_PANIC_REBOOT
    bool "Reboot on panic"
    ---help---
       Reboot the system on kernel panic(). This force the device to
       reboot but the memory content is zeroified only at boot time.

    config KERNEL_PANIC_WIPE
    bool "Wipe the applications data and reboot"
    ---help---
       Wipe the applications data in RAM with zero and then reboot
       the device. This avoid attacks using panic & reboot action to
       get back the RAM content at early reboot time

  ---help---
  If Y, input chars on the kernel console will be echoed. There
  is no specific behavior behind this (no protocol, shell or others),
  only a character echo in the ISR.

config KERNEL_DMA_ENABLE
  bool "Enable secure DMA kernel support"
  default y
  ---help---
  This permits to allow tasks to declare DMA stream usage with
  kernel control for address and channel management. If you
  say n here, any DMA declaration will return SYS_E_DENIED.

config KERNEL_GETCYCLES
  bool "Kernel support for DWT-based getcycles()"
  default y
  depends on STM32F4
  select DWT
  ---help---
  Add support for sys_getcycles() syscall, which returns a value
  in cycles instead of ticks, which is more precise.

config KERNEL_DOMAIN
  bool "Kernel support tasks domains"
  default n
  ---help---
  If yes, it is possible to set a specific domain for each task (based on
  a uint8_t value). Task from a same domain can communicate, tasks from
  different domains cannot (no IPC, no shared DMA spaces, get_taskid return
  SYS_E_INVAL, etc.). Each task can declare its domain as 'APP_APPNAME_DOMAIN'
  in the Kconfig system. If no domain is specific, the task is member of the
  default domain 0. Kernel domains has no impact on the scheduling scheme.

    ---help---
    This is a classical Round Robin scheduler. ISR are still
    executed with a higher priority than the tasks.
  config SCHED_MLQ_RR
    bool "Multilevel Queue Round Robin"
    ---help---
    This is a basic, multilevel queues scheduling scheme with Round
    Robin scheduling for each queue. As priority as fixed,
    higher priority tasks *must* yield to let other task's main
    thread being executed.
    It is efficient for burst-based, high period and high priority
    tasks such as smartcard management.
  config SCHED_RAND
    bool "Random scheduler"
    ---help---
    Randomly choose a task in the task list at each schedule
    time, using the HW Random number generator.

  Set the scheduling period duration. Beware, this value has a huge
  impact on the overall system behavior.

# FISR violate the MLQ_RR priority management. FISR is efficient for
# Round-Robbin management for sporadic high reactivity constraints
# When using MLQ_RR, please use priority-based configuration to
# manage reactivity of tasks and ISRs

config SCHED_SUPPORT_FISR
  bool "ISR may force immediate one time main thread execution (perm based)"
  default y
  ---help---
  If y, the kernel support the TSK_FISR permission and associated
  behavior. This permit to tasks with this permission to force one single
  immediate schedule of its main thread just after a given ISR which
  as been configured with the flag IRQ_ISR_FORCE_MAINTHREAD.
  This execution slot can still be preempted by a physical IRQ or another
  ISR scheduling.

endif

config SCHED_SUPPORT_FIPC
  bool "IPC send may force immediate one time target task execution (perm based)"
  default n
  ---help---
  If y, the kernel support the TSK_FIPC permission and associated behavior.
  This permit to a task sending an IPC with reactivity constraint to force
  one signe immediate schedule of the target task, if this task is waiting for
  this IPC only. This highly reduce IPC latency but is still a scheduling violation.
  This execution slot can still be preempted by a physical IRQ or another
  ISR scheduling.

if KERNEL_EXPERT_MODE

config ISR_REACTIVITY
  bool "Optimize for ISR reactivity"
  default y
  ---help---
  If you say y here, the softirq will force its own scheduling when
  an ISR is waiting for schedule, even if there is also syscalls to
  execute. ISR are executed faster, but there is more scheduling of
  softirq in comparison with standard task's main threads.

  Specify the maximum number of ISR waiting to be executed at a given time.
  This value can be increased up to 64 depending on the devices behavior,

  The kernel consider a queue overflow as a critical event and panic.
